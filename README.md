# Improvements-for-Part-3

The entire contact section is placed inside a white rounded card with:

Soft shadows

Smooth edges

Balanced spacing

White background

Center alignment


This makes the page look professional and easier to read.


---

✔ Improved color scheme (brand-matching)

The page now uses:

Green (#2A5A2F) for headings → matches the agricultural theme.

Purple gradient buttons (#667eea → #764ba2) → gives a modern, clean look.

Black/Gray text for readability.


This brings unity across all your website pages.


---

✔ Better spacing & layout

Spacing improvements include:

40px padding around the contact card

Better spacing between list items

Larger text for easier reading

Even spacing in the form fields


These upgrades dramatically improve clarity and visual flow.


---

✅ 2. Structural Improvements

✔ Clean, labeled form fields

The enquiry form now includes:

Full Name

Email

Subject

Message


Each field has:

Labels for accessibility

Proper placeholders

Required input rules


This makes your form functional, readable, and professional-looking.


---

✔ Mobile-friendly responsive layout

The CSS includes a @media section that:

Adjusts padding

Resizes text

Shrinks form fields

Keeps the layout centered


This ensures the page looks beautiful on phones, tablets, and desktop screens.


---

✅ 3. Functional Improvements

✔ Clickable email & phone

The email and phone number are now coded like this:

mailto:phuzisk@gmai.com

tel:0677108394


A visitor can now:

Tap the email → automatically opens Gmail

Tap the phone number → automatically starts a call


This improves usability.


---

✔ Highlighted active navigation

The navigation bar can highlight which page the user is currently on.

Example:

<li><a href="contact.html" class="active">Contact</a></li>

Your CSS already supports .active, so the Contact page gets a different color.

The contact page was upgraded so:

Colors match the About, Home, Services, Testimonials

Navigation is consistent

Spacing and fonts align with the overall theme


This gives your site a unified brand identity.

28px for main headings

Clear labels and spacing


Clean typography = easier reading and better professionalism.

✔ Semantic structure

Using <section>, <header>, <nav>, <form>, <label> helps:

Google understand your page

Screen readers navigate better

Search engines index your website more effectively



---
